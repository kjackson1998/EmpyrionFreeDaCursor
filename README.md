# Empyrion Free Da Cursor

Empyrion confines the cursor to the window even when the cursor is visible (not being used for mouselook/steering). Unless the game had edge panning, which it does not seem to that I can tell, confing the mouse cursor is more an annoyance than useful. This frees the cursor from this evil tyranny.

# Prerequisites

None. Ridiculously simple mod.

# Installation

Download one of the releases here, and unzip into your mods directory:
* %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Steam\steamapps\common\Empyrion - Galactic Survival\Content\Mods

You should have a folder *FreeDaCursor* in the above directory and inside the *FreeDaCursor* folder should be the .dll and the .yaml files.

Restart the game and that's it. There's no visible messages that it's working other than now you can hit tab or F4 or bring up any sort of UX that shows the cursor, and it should not be confined to the window any longer.

If it doesn't seem to be working, check your Empyrion log files and let me know if there's any errors. They are at:

* %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Steam\steamapps\common\Empyrion - Galactic Survival\Logs

Thanks!
